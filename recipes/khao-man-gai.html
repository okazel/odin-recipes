    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 pc skin-on, bone-in chicken thigh</li>
      <li>1 large skin-on chicken breast (or 2 small ones)</li>
      <li>1⁄2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trim extra fat and skin off your chicken thighs and reserve. You will
        need to render fat from these trimmings for the rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle salt over chicken and rub it in. Let sit at room temp while you
        prep other things.Note: You can do everything from this point on right
        in the pot that you will use to cook the rice and chicken, and it'll be
        a one pot meal. But I prefer to sauté the rice in a wok and then
        transfer.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a wok, or the pot you're using to cook the rice in, add just a tiny
        bit of vegetable oil along with chicken fat/skin trimmings. Saute over
        medium-low heat to render chicken fat until the trimmings are browned.
        You want to have about 2 tablespoon of fat total, so if there is too
        much, remove some. If there isn't enough, add a little more vegetable
        oil to supplement. Remove chicken trimmings, leaving the fat in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot/wok you used to render chicken fat, add chopped ginger
        and garlic and saute over medium high heat until garlic starts to turn
        golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add raw, rinsed rice and salt, and turn heat up to high, tossing rice
        for about 2 minutes until hot throughout and dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer rice into a rice cooker or a heavy bottomed pot (unless you're
        already using that pot). Note: A rice cooker is more convenient, because
        it will turn itself off, but I personally prefer using a pot so I can
        use low heat to gently cook the chicken so it will be less likely to
        overcook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken stock to the rice and and stir to mix. Place chicken in one
        layer on top of rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat to high and watch until you start to see the first sign of
        simmering. Then turn the heat down to low, cover with a tight fitting
        lid and cook for 25 minutes or until the chicken is done. While you wait
        for it to cook, make the dipping sauce and the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        When chicken is cooked, remove chicken from the rice and let rest for at
        least 5 minutes before slicing.
      </li>
      <li>Fluff rice to distribute seasoning and chicken juices evenly.</li>
      <li>
        To serve: Slice chicken into thin pieces, and place on top of rice.
        Serve with dipping sauce, some fresh cucumber and extra chicken broth as
        soup. Enjoy!
